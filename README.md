### Design & Development Notes
Notes for design, development and implementation for this project can be found here:
https://github.com/molikmiah/Pad/projects/2
This is an overview of the features, what the user expects and possible tools and frameworks that can be used to develop this app.

### Contributions
At this moment in time contributions from the community may be dismissed as the app is at the first stages of development and this is a personal project. However, once a solid foundation is laid down, i would be more than happy to allow the community to contribute to the development of this app.
